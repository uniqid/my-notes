    Build standalone executables(without console):
    cxfreeze script.py --target-dir dist --base-name=Win32GUI --icon=logo.ico

    Note:
        - py2exe:报模块丢失
        - pyinstaller: 可以打包成单一可执行文件，但是杀毒软件报木马

#Usage: cxfreeze [options] [SCRIPT]#

Freeze a Python script and all of its referenced modules to a base
executable which can then be distributed without requiring a Python
installation.
	
	Options:
	  --version             show program's version number and exit
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -O                    optimize generated bytecode as per PYTHONOPTIMIZE; use
	                        -OO in order to remove doc strings
	  -c, --compress        compress byte code in zip files
	  -s, --silent          suppress all output except warnings and errors
	  --base-name=NAME      file on which to base the target file; if the name of
	                        the file is not an absolute file name, the
	                        subdirectory bases (rooted in the directory in which
	                        the freezer is found) will be searched for a file
	                        matching the name
	  --init-script=NAME    script which will be executed upon startup; if the
	                        name of the file is not an absolute file name, the
	                        subdirectory initscripts (rooted in the directory in
	                        which the cx_Freeze package is found) will be searched
	                        for a file matching the name
	  --target-dir=DIR, --install-dir=DIR
	                        the directory in which to place the target file and
	                        any dependent files
	  --target-name=NAME    the name of the file to create instead of the base
	                        name of the script and the extension of the base
	                        binary
	  --no-copy-deps        do not copy the dependent files (extensions, shared
	                        libraries, etc.) to the target directory; this also
	                        modifies the default init script to ConsoleKeepPath.py
	                        and means that the target executable requires a Python
	                        installation to execute properly
	  --default-path=DIRS   list of paths separated by the standard path separator
	                        for the platform which will be used to initialize
	                        sys.path prior to running the module finder
	  --include-path=DIRS   list of paths separated by the standard path separator
	                        for the platform which will be used to modify sys.path
	                        prior to running the module finder
	  --replace-paths=DIRECTIVES
	                        replace all the paths in modules found in the given
	                        paths with the given replacement string; multiple
	                        values are separated by the standard path separator
	                        and each value is of the form path=replacement_string;
	                        path can be * which means all paths not already
	                        specified
	  --include-modules=NAMES
	                        comma separated list of modules to include
	  --exclude-modules=NAMES
	                        comma separated list of modules to exclude
	  --ext-list-file=NAME  name of file in which to place the list of dependent
	                        files which were copied into the target directory
	  -z SPEC, --zip-include=SPEC
	                        name of file to add to the zip file or a specification
	                        of the form name=arcname which will specify the
	                        archive name to use; multiple --zip-include arguments
	                        can be used
	--icon=ICON name of the icon file for the application
